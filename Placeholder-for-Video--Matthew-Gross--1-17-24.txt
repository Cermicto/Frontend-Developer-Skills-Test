Hi, I wanted to get you some videos to give an idea of my personality. I have a growth under my tongue that is preventing me from opening my mouth to talk at the moment. My YouTube channel is:

I have videos there I shot in Thailand years ago. I should be better soon and will shoot an introduction video for you. I also embedded these videos in the carousel slider in the "index-enhanced.html" file if you want to watch that way. Sorry for the inconvenience with my mouth. I have attached my planned video notes with the zip file I uploaded with the website in it. 

I hope you enjoy my code and the job I did on the Skills Test Website.

There are a couple example websites I've created WordPress and SPA themes for if you'd like to take a look:

Single Page Application Website (all hand coded): https://webpriorities.purelydetailed.com/
WordPress Theme & My Blog: https://webpriorities.purelydetailed.com/wp/

Have a great day!
